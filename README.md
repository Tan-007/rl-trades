# rl-trades
Rocket league trade automation scripts for two platforms, discord and gameflip.

## Warning
These scripts were made for learning purpose only. Please use these scripts at your own risk. The discord script was supposed to be used only for "trade central", and is highly unoptimized. I suggest you seek permission from the server admins before using this script as you may get banned from the server.

Note: Gameflip trade script isn't working anymore.

# Instructions
- Put all your trade details in the text files inside discord_trades folder.
- You will need to enter the OTP for your gameflip account at the beginning of the execution.
- You will need [selenium(python)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium) and [Chrome Driver-WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
